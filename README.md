# TypeScript-Rollup-Babel Build Tool
This tool provides a simple build tool for build simple SPA apps in native TypeScript.  It leverages Rollup.js and Babel for ES transpilation. Support for Sass is also included, along with a lite server to aid development.

**NON-CAUTION:** npm will provide a vulnerability on install.  Don't panic.  These warnings are linked to two dev dependencies, *watch-cli* and *lite-server*, and have no impact on your completed project.
